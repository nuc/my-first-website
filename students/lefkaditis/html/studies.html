<h1>The School Years</h1>
My studies so long aren't that impressive!!!I graduated from High School 2 years ago and i managed to<br>
get in TEI Hlektrologias in Kavala a city near Thessaloniki. I didn't go to this "school" because i didn't liked it!!!<br>
<br><br><br>
<h1>English Studies</h1>
I have been studying the English language since i was 11. I got the first certificate back in 1995 with grade C.<br>
I didn't go further because i didn't want to( <b>what a fool!!!!</b>). Now I'm planing to take the exam for the proficiency degree<br>
or for the IELTS degree so i can go in a university in England.
<br><br><br>
<h1>Present</h1>
Now i'm studying at City College in Thessaloniki. I'm in the computer science department. This is something<br>
i allways wanted to do because i love working with computers.
